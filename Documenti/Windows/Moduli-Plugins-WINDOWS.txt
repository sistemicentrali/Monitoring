FileLogger.dll
	A module that logs all messages to file if no logging module is loaded no error messages will be
	logged thus it is hard to find problems.

CheckExternalScripts.dll
	This module allows you to check external scripts and/or programs. 

LUAScript.dll
	This module allows you to write and change checks in the Lua scripting language. For a quite "guide"
	on how to write scripts for NSClient++ see the LUAScript/guide page. For information on the Lua
	scripting language and built-in modules and commands refer to the official Lua pages at: 
	http://www.lua.org/ and http://lua-users.org/wiki/SampleCode

NRPEListener.dll
	This module accepts incoming NRPE connections and responds by executing various checks and returns
	their result. To use this you need to have check_nrpe or another NRPE client. This is similar to
	check_nt (NSClient) but much more flexible and supports encryption. This only drawback is that it
	lacks any authorization.
	As this module has the ability to generate command handlers by configuration there are command
	handlers but nothing built in. This is present for compatiblity only it is suggested to use the
	[CheckExternalScripts] instead.

NSClientListener.dll
	The NSClientListener module is written to allow backwards compatibility with the old NSClient and
	check_nt. It has a listener (server) that accepts checks from the check_nt command and responds
	accordingly. Due to the nature of the protocol and the limitation in the client NRPE is recommended
	but if you like this works just fine for "simple things".
	The following check_nt checks are supported.
		* CLIENTVERSION
		* CPULOAD
		* UPTIME
		* USEDDISKSPACE
		* MEMUSE
		* SERVICESTATE
		* PROCSTATE
		* COUNTER  

NSCAAgent.dll
	This module periodically runs a set of check_commands and submits the results to an NSCA server.

RemoteConfiguration
	DEPRECATED Don't use the module unless you have a reason :)

SysTray.dll
	A simple module to show an icon in the tray when the service is running this module does not export
	any check commands.
	NOTICE This is not used on windows vista and above!
